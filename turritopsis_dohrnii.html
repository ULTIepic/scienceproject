        <h1>Turritopsis dohrnii - The Immortal Jellyfish</h1>
        <p>
            Turritopsis dohrnii, also known as the incapable of dying jellyfish, is a group of small, 
            biologically immortal jellyfish found worldwide in mild to tropical waters. It is one of 
            the few known cases of animals capable of returning completely to a sexually immature, 
            colonial stage after having reached sexual maturity as a single individual.
        </p>
        <p>
            Like most other hydrozoans, T. dohrnii begin their lives as tiny, free-swimming larvae 
            known as planulae. As a planula settles down, it gives rise to a colony of polyps that 
            are attached to the sea floor. All the polyps and jellyfish arising from a single planula 
            are genetically identical copies. The polyps form into a highly branched form, which is 
            not commonly seen in most jellyfish. Medusae, or jellyfish, then bud off these polyps and 
            continue their life in a free-swimming form, eventually becoming sexually mature.
        </p>
        <p>
            If the T. dohrnii jellyfish is exposed to environmental stress, physical attack, or is sick 
            or old, it can revert to the polyp stage, forming a new polyp colony. It does this through 
            the cell development process of transdifferentiation, which changes the state of the cells 
            and transforms them into new types of cells.
        </p>
        <p>
            This process theoretically allows the jellyfish to live indefinitely, effectively making 
            Turritopsis dohrnii biologically immortal. However, in nature, most Turritopsis dohrnii 
            are likely to succumb to predation or disease in the medusa stage before reverting to polyps.
        </p>
        <p>
            The ability of biological immortality with no maximum lifespan makes T. dohrnii an important 
            target of basic biological aging and medical research.
