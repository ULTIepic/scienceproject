    <h1>Transdifferentiation</h1>
    <p>Also known as family reprogramming, transdifferentiation is the process in which one mature body-related cell is changed into another mature body-related cell without going through a pluripotent state or ancestor cell type. It is a type of metaplasia, which includes all cell fate switches, including the interconversion of stem cells. Current uses of transdifferentiation include disease modeling and drug discovery, and in the future may include gene therapy and regenerative medicine.</p>
    
    <h2>Discovery</h2>
    <p>Davis et al. 1987 reported the first instance of transdifferentiation where a cell changed from one adult cell type to another. Forcing mouse embryonic fibroblasts to express MyoD was found to be sufficient to turn those cells into myoblasts.</p>
    
    <h2>Natural Examples</h2>
    <p>The only known events where adult cells change directly from one family to another happen in the species Turritopsis dohrnii (also known as the immortal jellyfish) and Turritopsis nutricula. In newts, when the eye lens is removed, pigmented iris cells dedifferentiate and then redifferentiate into lens cells.</p>
    
    <h2>Caused and Medically Helpful Examples</h2>
    <p>The first example of functional transdifferentiation has been given by Ferber et al. by causing a shift in the developmental fate of cells in the liver and converting them into pancreatic beta-cell-like cells. The transdifferentiated beta-like cells were found to be resistant to autoimmune attack that characterizes type 1 diabetes. Additionally, research has demonstrated that certain ovarian and testicular cells can transdifferentiate via induced genetic modifications.</p>
    
    <h2>Methods</h2>
    <p>Transdifferentiation can be induced through various methods, including transcription factor activation, chemical agents, and genetic modification. Body-related cells are first transfected with pluripotent reprogramming factors before being transfected with the desired differentiation or activation factors. The DNA methylation inhibitor, 5-azacytidine, is also known to promote phenotypic transdifferentiation of cardiomyocytes to skeletal myoblasts.</p>
    
    <h2>Issues</h2>
    <p>There are several challenges associated with transdifferentiation. Generally, transdifferentiation that occurs in mouse cells does not always translate effectively to human cells. The order of expression of transcription factors can direct the fate of the cell, and improper sequencing may hinder successful reprogramming. Immunogenicity remains a concern, as foreign molecules entering cells can lead to immune rejection. Additionally, the method of transfection must be carefully considered to minimize potential risks, including tumorigenesis.</p>
