        <h1>Transdifferentiation</h1>
        <p><strong>Also known as family reprogramming</strong>, is the process in which one mature body-related cell is changed into another mature body-related cell without going through a pluripotent state or ancestor cell type. It is a type of metaplasia, which includes all cell fate switches, including the interconversion of stem cells...</p>
        
        <h2>Discovery</h2>
        <p>Davis et al. 1987 reported the first instance of transdifferentiation where a cell changed from one adult cell type to another...</p>
        
        <h2>Natural Examples</h2>
        <p>The only known events where adult cells change directly from one family to another happen in the species Turritopsis dohrnii...</p>
        
        <h2>Caused and Medically Helpful Examples</h2>
        <p>The first example of functional transdifferentiation has been given by Ferber et al. by causing a shift in the developmental fate of cells...</p>
        
        <h2>Methods</h2>
        <p>Body-related cells are first transfected with pluripotent reprogramming factors before being transfected with the desired factors...</p>
        
        <h2>Issues</h2>
        <p>Generally, transdifferentiation that happens in mouse cells does not translate in effectiveness in human cells...</p>
